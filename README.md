# RoundCubeClone
Clone of RoundCube for school project.
Project for course CSIS400, Linux/Unix.

Description:
My goal for this project was to create and edit a new skin for the RondCubeMail project.
For this skin, I created a "Siena College" version of RoundCube. I edited the html and css
files to make it ressemble the Siena College website (www.Siena.edu). Design is an extremely 
important aspect of any project, big or small. I wanted to show users differences in design, 
even simple ones, that could greatly affect the usage of a program. My changes here don't effect 
functionality of the project RoundCubeMail.
